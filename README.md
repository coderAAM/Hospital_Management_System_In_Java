🏥 Java + DBMS Project | Hospital Management System

I have successfully developed a Hospital Management System using Java with DBMS (JDBC) and MySQL. This project is fully connected to a database, where all hospital data is stored and managed efficiently.

🔹 Project Features:

Store and manage patient records

Add new patients to the system

Track total number of patients

Manage available doctors

Handle and monitor appointments

Secure data storage using MySQL database

This project helped me deeply understand Core Java, OOP concepts, and database connectivity using JDBC. I implemented concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, methods, and modular design to build a clean and structured system.

Working on this project improved my understanding of how real-world applications interact with databases and how backend logic is designed in Java-based systems.

📌 Key Learnings:

Core Java fundamentals

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

JDBC & MySQL integration

Database design & data handling

Backend logic & problem solving

This project is a strong step in my journey toward becoming a skilled Java & Full Stack Developer, and I’m continuously improving my skills by moving forward with DSA and advanced concepts.
